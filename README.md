Review the generated code and run the application. What new c# concepts did you learn while doing this?

Ive never heard of all the event handling it uses, im not one to really work with those at this point in my education.

The mouseclick things and the shapes being made I was never aware of how that works. 


What prompts did you use?

--1
Create a C# WPF application to manage shapes on a canvas (you should be able to click a button to add circles, drag a circle and change its position) 
--2
How do I create this project in vscode
--3
Can you make it so there are options to add different shapes and then also move them around 


How did you fix issues/errors if you ran into any?
Didnt run into any errors, from the first prompt it didnt add multiple shapes so I added that in another prompt
